## In a Gist

I'm a software engineer at heart with a passion to efficiently transform business requirements to high-quality software.
I love programming and to explore how teams and organizations can improve, and work together to reach a common vision.

I was also trained as Scrum Master in a course by Jeff Sutherland, and am generally interested in modern approaches on how to collaborate in software. 
Moreover, I have an AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification.
